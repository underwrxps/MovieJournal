As a movie fanatic, I want a place to put down my thoughts on all of the movies I watch so I can reread and add to them later.

As a movie reviewer, I want a personal space to document my thoughts on the movie I watch so that I can keep those thoughts separate from a critical review.

As someone who doesn't watch a lot of movies, I want a place to log the films I watch so I can remember what I've already seen and how I felt about it.
